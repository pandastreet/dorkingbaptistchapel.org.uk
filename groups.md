## Groups




### **Men's and Ladies' Bible study groups**

Bible study groups meet monthly, to jointly discover and understand passages from the Bible.  For more details contact: Anna Mason on 07970 668895 or Peter Hollands on 01306 885382. 

### **Tiddlywinks**

Tiddlywinks is the name of our mother/father/carer and toddler group. We are a small and friendly group and meet every Monday morning in school term time from 10:00-11:30am. There are lots of toys for the tots to play with while carers have a well earned cup of tea/coffee! There is also a dedicated baby area, and all ages from birth to age 5 are welcome. A craft activity is provided during the morning too, as well as refreshments, and the morning is rounded off with a time of nursery rhyme singing along with actions and instruments. New carers always welcome.  Contact Anna Mason, telephone: 07970 668895
