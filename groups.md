## Groups


### Trailblazers

Trailblazers is for children in secondary school. We meet on alternate Fridays from 7 to 9pm. There is a different activity each week e.g craft, games, cooking, themed evenings, trips out, and we finish with a story from the Bible. We have lots of fun!

### Builders

Every Sunday morning, before the main service, for 40 minutes or so we learn together from the Bible, using craft, games, discussions and other activities to apply the Bible’s teaching to our lives. 

### Tiddlywinks

Tiddlywinks is the name of our mother/father/carer and toddler group. We are a small and friendly group and meet every Monday morning in term time from 10:00-11:30am. There are lots of toys for the tots to play with while carers have a well earned cup of tea/coffee! There is also a dedicated baby area, and all ages from birth to 5 are welcome. A craft activity is provided during the morning too, as well as refreshments, and the morning is rounded off with a time of nursery rhyme singing along with actions and instruments. New carers always welcome.
