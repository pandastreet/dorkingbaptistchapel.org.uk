## Groups

### Focus

Focus is our group for teenagers. We meet on the last Saturday of the month.

### Trailblazers

Trailblazers is for children in school years 4 to 8. We meet on Fridays from 7 to 8:15pm. There is a different activity each week e.g craft, games, cooking, themed evenings, trips out, and we finish with a story from the Bible. We have lots of fun!

### Builders

Every Sunday morning for 40 minutes or so we learn together from the Bible, using craft, games, discussions and other activities to apply the Bibleâ€™s teaching to our lives. Starting at 10am there are 2 age groups - one for the 8-11s and one for the 11-14s.

### Tiddlywinks

Tiddlywinks is the name of our mother/father/carer and toddler group. We are a small and friendly group and meet every Monday morning in term time from 10:00-11:30am. There are lots of toys for the tots to play with while carers have a well earned cup of tea/coffee! There is also a dedicated baby area, and all ages from birth to 5 are welcome. A craft activity is provided during the morning too, as well as refreshments, and the morning is rounded off with a time of nursery rhyme singing along with actions and instruments. New carers always welcome.
