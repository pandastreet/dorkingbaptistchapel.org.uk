## About Us

We are an independent church having links with the Association of Grace Baptist Churches (south east), Grace Baptist Trust Corporation, Grace Baptist Assembly, Grace Baptist Mission and Affinity.

We are a group of ordinary people who believe the Bible to be the inspired Word of God having a relevance to our daily lives and who seek to discover the meaning of the Bible at each of our meetings.

We are a people who believe that Jesus Christ, God's Son, died on the cross to take away our sins.

We are a people who would like to share what we have discovered with you and invite you to come and join us at our services where we will give you a warm welcome.

We use a modern version of the Bible and sing both old and new hymns and songs.
